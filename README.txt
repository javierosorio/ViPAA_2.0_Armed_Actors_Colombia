This repository contains the replication files and database to generate the Violent Presence of Armed Actors in Colombia (ViPAA) v2.0 event database.

ViPPA provides geo-referenced data at the daily municipal level related to the violent presence of armed actors in Colombia between 1988 and 2019.

The data categorizes armed actors in five main types:
- Government forces
- Insurgent organizations
- Paramilitary groups
- Criminal organizations
- FARC Dissidents

Each of these types of actors is further disaggregated in a multitude of specific organizations.   

ViPPA is generated using computerized text annotation with Eventus ID, a protocol for supervised event coding capable of geo-referencing actors mentioned in text written in Spanish (Osorio & Reyes 2016).

The information used as an input for the computerized coding came from Noche y Niebla, a collection of narratives of human rights violations published by the Centro de Investigación y Educación Popular, CINEP.
